# Whiteboard Interview Advice
The Jist: **Communicate!**
- ask questions, learn more about the problem before diving right into the technical problem
1. Restate the question
2. Ask about edge cases
3. Ask about test cases
4. Write pseudocode and ask if it makes sense
5. Write the actual code and ask if it looks good
6. Ask for help if you are stuck
    - ask it in a good phrase... "I am a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?"
