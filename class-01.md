# Readings for Class 1

## Pain and Suffering
- over the next 10 weeks of this course, I will be learning information that typically takes two years to complete
    - this requires intense physical, mental, and emotional pain
    - there will be points during this course where I will become extremely worried and tired!
    - with pain comes growth, but do not confuse this with *suffering*
        - *suffering* is pain without purpose, without no higher goal, and with no dreams or ambition

- *AS I WORK THROUGH THIS*
    - What’s your perspective?
    - Why are you doing this?
    - Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
    - Are you doing this for you?

- as I experience pain, recognize remedy and build my resources and my community, do not go through the pain on your own as that leads to suffering

"It’s not easy, nor is it common. This is why such skilled people are highly-valued in the industry. You are building your value. You are experiencing the pain of growth. Live it, love it, and take it forward into your future as a full-stack software developer capable of meeting all challenges with a clear head and strong heart."

## O Notation
- big O notation is used in CS to describe performance of an algorithm where it describes the worst-case scenario / execution time
- O(1) = algorithm where time is executed in same amount of time regardless of size
- O(N) = algorithm where performance grows linearly in proportion to size of input data set
- O(N2) = alogrithm whose performance is proportional to square of size of data set
...
    ## Logarithms
    - binary search is used to search sorted data sets where it selects the middle element of data set, and compares it against a target value
